skips: ['B108', 'B110']

# B108: Hardcoded temp directory - intentional use of /tmp for Ansible cache
#       The cache directory is configurable and uses proper permissions (0o700)
# B110: try-except-pass - used intentionally for cleanup operations where
#       failures are acceptable and shouldn't break the main flow

# Feature Specification: Improved Test Design for ZeroSSL Plugin

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-original-test`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The original test (tests/component, tests/unit) failures were symptoms of poorly designed tests, not necessarily broken functionality. A better approach would be to: 1. Fix the test design to use real method names and realistic scenarios 2. Mock minimally at the HTTP boundary only 3. Test real code paths to catch actual bugs Please check all the codes except integration directory."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified: test design issues, over-mocking, unrealistic scenarios
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: test developers, CI/CD systems, plugin users
   � Actions: fix test design, use real methods, mock minimally, test real paths
   � Data: test files in tests/unit and tests/component directories
   � Constraints: avoid changing integration tests, maintain test coverage
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � None identified - requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: analyze current tests � redesign � implement improvements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Test classes, mock objects, HTTP boundaries, method signatures
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No implementation details, focused on test quality outcomes
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT test quality outcomes are needed and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific testing frameworks, code structure)
- =e Written for QA engineers and test architects, not just developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: How should test coverage be measured for the improved tests? → A: Line coverage percentage (e.g., 80% minimum)
- Q: What should be the maximum acceptable test execution time for the improved test suite? → A: Under 30 seconds total for all unit/component tests
- Q: How should test failures be categorized and reported? → A: Simple pass/fail with error message only

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a QA engineer working on the ZeroSSL Ansible plugin, I need the unit and component tests to accurately validate real plugin functionality so that test failures indicate actual bugs rather than test design issues, enabling reliable continuous integration and confident deployments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing unit test for certificate creation, **When** the test runs, **Then** it should exercise the actual CertificateManager.create_certificate method with realistic parameters and only mock the HTTP requests to ZeroSSL API
2. **Given** a component test for full automation workflow, **When** the test executes, **Then** it should follow the complete code path through ActionModule methods with real method calls and only mock external API responses
3. **Given** a test that previously failed due to non-existent method calls, **When** the test is redesigned, **Then** it should call only methods that actually exist in the source code with correct signatures
4. **Given** an error handling test, **When** an API error occurs, **Then** the test should verify how the real code handles the error rather than mocking the error handling logic itself

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tests try to validate method signatures that don't match the actual implementation?
- How does the system handle when mocks are too granular and break real object interactions?
- What occurs when tests pass but don't actually exercise the code paths they claim to test?
- How should test framework report failures using simple pass/fail status with descriptive error messages?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST use only method names and signatures that exist in the actual source code
- **FR-002**: Unit tests MUST mock exclusively at the HTTP/network boundary (requests.Session, HTTP responses)
- **FR-003**: Component tests MUST exercise real ActionModule method calls and internal object interactions
- **FR-004**: Tests MUST follow realistic execution paths that mirror actual plugin usage scenarios and achieve minimum 80% line coverage
- **FR-005**: Error handling tests MUST validate actual exception propagation and handling logic
- **FR-006**: Mock objects MUST represent only external dependencies (ZeroSSL API, file system operations)
- **FR-007**: Test assertions MUST verify real output data structures and state changes
- **FR-008**: Certificate lifecycle tests MUST use realistic ZeroSSL API response formats
- **FR-009**: Validation workflow tests MUST test actual domain validation logic with mocked HTTP responses
- **FR-010**: Test fixtures MUST provide realistic certificate data that matches ZeroSSL API schemas
- **FR-011**: Complete unit and component test suite execution MUST complete within 30 seconds

### Key Entities
- **Test Classes**: Unit and component test classes that need redesign to use real method calls
- **Mock Boundaries**: HTTP session objects, API responses, file system operations that should be mocked
- **Method Signatures**: Actual method definitions in source code that tests must match exactly
- **API Response Formats**: Realistic ZeroSSL API response structures for test fixtures
- **Certificate Data**: Valid certificate content, CSR data, and validation challenges for testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Real exception types and error conditions that can occur in production

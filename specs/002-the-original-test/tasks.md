- **Test Data**: Integrated with existing tests/fixtures/zerossl_responses.py
- **Coverage**: Branch coverage enabled, HTML/XML reporting configured
- **Performance**: 30-second execution limit configured for parallel testing
- **Contract Enforcement**: Real-time validation of test quality and coverage

### Critical Infrastructure Fix âœ… COMPLETED
**Issue**: Component test improvements broke unit test compatibility due to `mock_http_boundary` fixture API changes.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Dual API Support**: Enhanced `mock_http_boundary` fixture to support both test patterns:
   - Unit tests: `mock_http_boundary('/endpoint', response_data, status_code=200)`
   - Component tests: `mock_http_boundary('scenario')`

2. **Endpoint Matching Algorithm**: Fixed endpoint conflict resolution:
   - Exact matches prioritized over prefix matches
   - `/certificates/nonexistent` now matches correctly instead of broader `/certificates`
   - Multiple endpoint mocks accumulate instead of overwriting

3. **Session Patching**: Restructured HTTP session patching to:
   - Set up patches once per test fixture
   - Allow multiple endpoint configurations
   - Maintain backward compatibility

**Results**:
- âœ… All unit tests now pass (test_api_client.py: 19/19, test_certificate_manager.py: 19/19)
- âœ… All component tests remain passing (64/64 tests)
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained for future test development
- âœ… Infrastructure ready for Phase 3.5 integration and validation work

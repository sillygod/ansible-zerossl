# Data Model: Test Design Improvement

## Test Entities

### TestCase
**Purpose**: Represents individual unit or component test methods
**Attributes**:
- `name`: Test method name (must match actual source code methods)
- `test_type`: "unit" | "component"
- `target_module`: Module under test (e.g., "CertificateManager", "ZeroSSLAPIClient")
- `coverage_target`: Expected line coverage percentage (minimum 80%)
- `execution_time_limit`: Maximum execution time in seconds
- `mock_boundaries`: List of external dependencies to mock
- `assertions`: Expected outputs and state changes to verify

**Validation Rules**:
- `name` must correspond to existing method in source code
- `mock_boundaries` can only include HTTP, filesystem, or external API calls
- `execution_time_limit` must be ≤ 30 seconds for individual tests
- `coverage_target` must be ≥ 80%

**State Transitions**:
- Draft → Ready (when method signatures verified)
- Ready → Passing (when test executes successfully)
- Passing → Failed (when underlying code changes break test)

### MockBoundary
**Purpose**: Defines what external dependencies should be mocked in tests
**Attributes**:
- `boundary_type`: "http_request" | "file_operation" | "external_api"
- `mock_target`: Specific target to mock (e.g., "requests.Session.get")
- `response_format`: Expected response structure for HTTP mocks
- `test_scenarios`: List of scenarios this boundary supports

**Validation Rules**:
- `boundary_type` must be external dependency, not internal business logic
- `mock_target` must be at infrastructure layer
- `response_format` must match real ZeroSSL API schemas

### TestFixture
**Purpose**: Reusable test data and mock configurations
**Attributes**:
- `fixture_name`: Pytest fixture name
- `scope`: "function" | "class" | "module" | "session"
- `data_type`: "api_response" | "certificate_data" | "error_scenario"
- `realistic_data`: Boolean indicating if data matches production formats
- `dependencies`: Other fixtures this depends on

**Validation Rules**:
- `realistic_data` must be true for all API response fixtures
- `scope` must align with test isolation requirements
- Certificate data must follow valid PEM format structure

### CoverageMetric
**Purpose**: Tracks test coverage and performance metrics
**Attributes**:
- `module_name`: Source module being measured
- `line_coverage_percent`: Actual coverage percentage achieved
- `branch_coverage_percent`: Branch coverage if available
- `test_execution_time`: Total time for module's tests
- `meets_requirements`: Boolean indicating if thresholds met

**Validation Rules**:
- `line_coverage_percent` must be ≥ 80%
- `test_execution_time` for all tests must be ≤ 30 seconds
- `meets_requirements` = true only when both coverage and time requirements met

## Relationships

### TestCase → MockBoundary (1:N)
- Each test case can define multiple mock boundaries
- Mock boundaries are reused across multiple test cases
- Relationship validated to ensure only external dependencies mocked

### TestCase → TestFixture (N:M)
- Test cases can use multiple fixtures
- Fixtures can be shared across multiple test cases
- Dependency graph must be acyclic to prevent fixture conflicts

### TestCase → CoverageMetric (N:1)
- Multiple test cases contribute to single module's coverage metric
- Coverage aggregated across all tests for a module
- Individual test execution times summed for total module time

## Data Integrity Constraints

### Method Signature Validation
- All test method calls must match actual source code signatures
- Test parameters must be compatible with real method parameter types
- Return value assertions must match actual method return types

### Mock Boundary Enforcement
- No mocking allowed of internal business logic methods
- Only HTTP requests, file operations, and external APIs can be mocked
- Mock responses must use realistic data formats

### Performance Constraints
- Individual test execution time ≤ 5 seconds
- Total test suite execution time ≤ 30 seconds
- Coverage measurement overhead ≤ 10% of execution time

### Quality Gates
- All tests must achieve ≥ 80% line coverage
- Zero tolerance for tests that don't exercise actual code paths
- All fixtures must provide realistic data matching production schemas

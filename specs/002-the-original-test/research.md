# Research: Improved Test Design for ZeroSSL Plugin

## HTTP Boundary Mocking

### Decision: Use pytest-mock with requests.Session patching
**Rationale**:
- Already available in current tech stack (pytest-mock>=3.11.0)
- Seamless integration with pytest fixtures via mocker fixture
- Direct control over requests.Session instances at HTTP boundary
- No new library introduction required
- Flexible patching capabilities for different HTTP methods

**Alternatives considered**:
- requests-mock library: Not available in current dependencies
- responses library: Requires decorator approach, more complex setup
- unittest.mock.patch: Too low-level, extensive configuration needed
- httpretty: Legacy option, not suitable for modern Python

## Business Logic Testing Strategy

### Decision: Mock only at infrastructure boundaries (HTTP, filesystem)
**Rationale**:
- Preserves ability to refactor without breaking tests
- Tests actual code paths instead of mocked interactions
- Reduces test brittleness and maintenance overhead
- Aligns with existing Ansible testing best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Method-level mocking: Rejected due to test brittleness
- Full integration testing: Too slow for unit test requirements
- Stub-based testing: More complex than boundary mocking

## Test Data Management

### Decision: Fixture-based realistic test data using existing pytest fixtures
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing conftest.py structure
- Provides realistic ZeroSSL API response formats
- Enables parameterized testing for multiple scenarios
- Maintains test data consistency across modules

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generated test data: Less realistic, harder to debug
- Inline test data: Harder to maintain, duplicated across tests
- External JSON files: Added complexity without significant benefit

## Coverage and Performance

### Decision: Use existing coverage>=7.3.0 with 80% target and pytest-xdist parallelization
**Rationale**:
- Already configured in pyproject.toml
- Meets specified 80% coverage requirement
- pytest-xdist available for parallel execution to meet 30-second constraint
- No additional library dependencies required

**Alternatives considered**:
- pytest-cov separately: Redundant with existing coverage setup
- Custom coverage tools: Unnecessary complexity
- Sequential test execution: Too slow for performance requirement

## Ansible-Specific Patterns

### Decision: Use pytest-ansible fixtures with modified mocking approach
**Rationale**:
- Already part of dev dependencies (pytest-ansible>=4.0.0)
- Provides ansible_module fixture for direct testing
- Handles Ansible module context properly
- Compatible with existing test infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct module imports: Missing Ansible context
- Custom test harness: Reinventing existing functionality
- Integration-only testing: Too slow for unit test coverage

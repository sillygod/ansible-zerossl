# Feature Specification: Ansible ZeroSSL Certificate Management Plugin

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-an-ansible`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop an ansible plugin which compatible with the latest version. This plugin use the zerossl APIs to automation the https certificates creation and renew. The current codebase has already handled these logics. Your tasks are to refactor the codebase to make it flexible and extensible. Make the structure consistent with the ansible official standard. In addition, ensure the code is well tested."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: Ansible plugin, ZeroSSL API integration, certificate automation, refactoring for standards compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Testing framework preferences may need clarification during implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows identified for certificate lifecycle management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on certificate management automation and code quality
6. Identify Key Entities (certificate, domain validation, API credentials)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Focus on business value rather than implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
DevOps engineers and system administrators need to automate SSL certificate management for their web services using ZeroSSL's free certificate authority. They want to integrate certificate creation, validation, renewal, and deployment seamlessly into their Ansible automation workflows without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new domain needs SSL protection, **When** the automation runs, **Then** a certificate is requested, validated, and deployed automatically
2. **Given** an existing certificate is approaching expiration, **When** the renewal check runs, **Then** the certificate is renewed before expiration without service interruption
3. **Given** multiple domains need certificates, **When** the automation processes them, **Then** all certificates are managed independently with proper error handling
4. **Given** validation files need to be placed for domain verification, **When** HTTP validation occurs, **Then** files are automatically placed in the correct web server locations
5. **Given** a certificate operation fails, **When** the automation retries, **Then** the system handles errors gracefully and provides clear feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ZeroSSL API rate limits are hit?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during certificate operations?
- What occurs when domain validation fails repeatedly?
- How are certificate operations handled when the target web server is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when certificate storage locations have permission issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide seamless certificate lifecycle management (request, validate, download, renew)
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect when certificates need renewal based on configurable thresholds
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle domain validation through HTTP-01 method with automatic file placement
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple domain certificates (SAN certificates)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide idempotent operations that can be safely run multiple times
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
- **FR-007**: System MUST store certificates in administrator-specified locations with proper permissions
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate configuration parameters before executing operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear status reporting for certificate operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both split-workflow operations (request/validate/download separately) and unified operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain compatibility with current Ansible versions
- **FR-012**: System MUST follow Ansible plugin development standards and conventions
- **FR-013**: System MUST include comprehensive test coverage for all certificate operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle concurrent certificate operations for different domains safely

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Certificate**: Represents an SSL/TLS certificate with domains, expiration date, status, and validation requirements
- **Domain Validation**: Represents the validation process including challenge files, URLs, and validation status
- **API Credentials**: Represents ZeroSSL API access keys and authentication information
- **Certificate Bundle**: Represents the combined certificate and certificate authority bundle for deployment

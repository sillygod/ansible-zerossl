# Implementation Plan: Ansible ZeroSSL Certificate Management Plugin

**Branch**: `001-develop-an-ansible` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-develop-an-ansible/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Refactor and enhance the existing Ansible ZeroSSL certificate management plugin to meet modern Ansible standards and provide comprehensive SSL certificate automation. The plugin will handle complete certificate lifecycle management (creation, validation, renewal, deployment) through ZeroSSL APIs with improved error handling, testing coverage, and architectural standards compliance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: Ansible (latest stable), requests/urllib3, cryptography, pytest
**Storage**: Local filesystem for certificates, temporary files for validation
**Testing**: pytest with Ansible test utilities, unit tests, integration tests
**Target Platform**: Linux/Unix systems running Ansible (multi-platform support)
**Project Type**: single - Ansible plugin module
**Performance Goals**: Handle 100+ concurrent certificate operations, <30s per cert lifecycle
**Constraints**: Ansible compatibility requirements, ZeroSSL API rate limits (300 requests/day free tier)
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise environments with 1000+ domains, plugin must be production-ready

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Plugin Standards Compliance**:
- [x] PASS: Plugin follows Ansible module development standards
- [x] PASS: Python 3.12 compatibility maintained
- [x] PASS: No unnecessary complexity - single purpose plugin

**Testing Requirements**:
- [x] PASS: Comprehensive test coverage planned (unit + integration)
- [x] PASS: TDD approach with failing tests before implementation
- [x] PASS: Contract tests for ZeroSSL API integration

**Architecture Principles**:
- [x] PASS: Single responsibility - certificate management only
- [x] PASS: Error handling and retry mechanisms planned
- [x] PASS: Idempotent operations as required by Ansible

**Structure Decision**: Ansible Action Plugin - follows Ansible collection standards with action_plugins/ as the main directory and module_utils/ for shared code

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Core architecture refactoring tasks based on existing codebase analysis
- Contract test tasks for ZeroSSL API endpoints [P]
- Data model implementation tasks [P]
- Plugin refactoring tasks following Ansible standards
- Integration test tasks covering user scenarios
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Test Setup Tasks** (5-7 tasks):
   - Create test structure following Ansible testing patterns
   - Contract tests for ZeroSSL API integration
   - Unit tests for module_utils components
   - Integration test scenarios from quickstart examples
   - Mock fixtures and sample certificate data

2. **Architecture Refactoring Tasks** (8-10 tasks):
   - Extract shared code to module_utils/zerossl/
   - Create APIClient in module_utils/zerossl/api_client.py
   - Create CertificateManager in module_utils/zerossl/certificate_manager.py
   - Create ValidationHandler in module_utils/zerossl/validation_handler.py
   - Implement custom exceptions in module_utils/zerossl/exceptions.py
   - Refactor main action plugin to use modular components
   - Update DOCUMENTATION/EXAMPLES/RETURN to Ansible standards
   - Add proper parameter validation using AnsibleModule patterns

3. **Enhancement Tasks** (10-12 tasks):
   - Implement DNS-01 validation support alongside HTTP-01
   - Add comprehensive logging using Ansible's display framework
   - Implement certificate caching and status optimization
   - Add concurrent operation support with proper locking
   - Improve rate limiting and exponential backoff retry logic
   - Add certificate renewal threshold configuration
   - Implement idempotent operations with proper change detection
   - Add support for custom CSR generation if needed

4. **Validation and Polish Tasks** (5-7 tasks):
   - Run full test suite with pytest and Ansible test runner
   - Performance testing for concurrent certificate operations
   - Security audit focusing on API key handling and file permissions
   - Create ansible.cfg and requirements.txt for proper setup
   - Update documentation with proper Ansible plugin examples
   - Validate plugin works with latest Ansible versions

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- Ansible-specific dependency order:
  1. module_utils foundations →
  2. API client and exceptions →
  3. Certificate and validation managers →
  4. Action plugin refactoring →
  5. Integration tests →
  6. Enhancements
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent module_utils components)
- Critical path: Test framework → module_utils refactoring → Action plugin update → Integration validation

**Estimated Output**: 28-36 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on refactoring existing code to meet modern standards

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

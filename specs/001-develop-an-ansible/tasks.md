## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.12, Ansible plugin structure, pytest testing
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 2 API contracts → contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 7 scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Ansible project structure, dependencies, testing framework
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration scenarios, unit tests
   → Core: module_utils refactoring, action plugin modernization
   → Integration: API client, validation handlers, error management
   → Polish: documentation, security audit, performance validation
4. Apply Ansible-specific task rules:
   → module_utils components = mark [P] for parallel
   → Action plugin refactoring = sequential (shared file)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. SUCCESS (32 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before everything
- Tests (T005-T017) before implementation (T018-T032)
- T018-T020 (models) before T021-T024 (components)
- T021-T024 (components) before T025-T028 (plugin refactoring)
- T025-T028 (plugin) before T029-T032 (integration)
- Implementation before polish (T033-T038)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2 - All Tests Together (after setup):
```bash
# Launch contract tests in parallel
Task: "Contract test ZeroSSL certificate creation API in tests/unit/test_zerossl_api_contract.py"
Task: "Contract test ZeroSSL certificate validation API in tests/unit/test_zerossl_validation_contract.py"
Task: "Contract test Ansible plugin interface in tests/unit/test_plugin_contract.py"

# Launch integration tests in parallel
Task: "Integration test: Full certificate automation scenario in tests/integration/test_full_automation.py"
Task: "Integration test: Split workflow (request/validate/download) in tests/integration/test_split_workflow.py"
Task: "Integration test: Certificate renewal check in tests/integration/test_renewal_check.py"
Task: "Integration test: Multi-domain (SAN) certificate in tests/integration/test_multi_domain.py"
Task: "Integration test: DNS validation workflow in tests/integration/test_dns_validation.py"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Core Components in Parallel:
```bash
# Launch module_utils components together (different files)
Task: "Certificate data model with enums in module_utils/zerossl/models.py"
Task: "Custom exceptions (ZeroSSLException hierarchy) in module_utils/zerossl/exceptions.py"
Task: "APIClient with rate limiting and retry logic in module_utils/zerossl/api_client.py"
Task: "CertificateManager for lifecycle operations in module_utils/zerossl/certificate_manager.py"
Task: "ValidationHandler for HTTP-01 and DNS-01 in module_utils/zerossl/validation_handler.py"
```

### Phase 3.6 - Polish Tasks in Parallel:
```bash
# Launch independent polish tasks
Task: "Create comprehensive test fixtures in tests/fixtures/"
Task: "Security audit: API key handling, file permissions, temporary file cleanup"
Task: "Update documentation: README.md, API reference, usage examples"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Action plugin refactoring (T025-T028) must be sequential (same file)
- module_utils components can be developed in parallel
- Integration tests validate complete user workflows from quickstart.md
- Contract tests ensure API compatibility with ZeroSSL and Ansible standards

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: 2 contract files → 3 contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 4 entities → 4 model/component tasks [P]
3. **From User Stories**: 7 quickstart scenarios → 7 integration tests [P]
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Components → Plugin → Integration → Polish
5. **Ansible-specific**: module_utils components parallel, action plugin sequential

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T007)
- [x] All entities have model/component tasks (T018-T024)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD approach: failing tests before implementation
- [x] Ansible plugin structure followed throughout
